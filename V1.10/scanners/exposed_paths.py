"""Checks a short, well-known list of paths that commonly get left
exposed by accident - backup files, version control metadata, environment
files, debug/management endpoints - the same kind of check covered by
basic security reviews and hardening guides. ZAP's own spider may also
surface some of these, but a direct, deterministic check catches things
that aren't linked from anywhere a crawler would find.

This is read-only black-box reconnaissance: a single GET request per
path, nothing more, with a short delay between requests. Every request
targets only the application you point this at.
