"""Runs the full multi-tool black-box scan pipeline.

Scanner stack (each independent, skipped gracefully if not installed):
  1. ZAP          — classic + Ajax spider + active scan at max thoroughness
  2. SQLMap       — deep SQL injection confirmation, all techniques
  3. Nuclei       — 4000+ CVE and vulnerability templates (2003 → 2026)
  4. Nikto        — web server misconfiguration + outdated software
  5. FFuf         — directory/file/admin panel discovery
  6. SSL scanner  — TLS/SSL weakness detection (SSLv2 → TLS 1.3 issues)
  7. Exposed paths — curated check for commonly left-exposed sensitive files
  8. NVD historic — fingerprint the target, then query NIST NVD for every
                    known CVE for detected technologies (1999 → 2026)

Together these cover every OWASP vulnerability class from 2003 to 2026.
None of this touches the Anthropic API — all findings land in the pending
queue and only reach Claude when you explicitly approve AI triage.
