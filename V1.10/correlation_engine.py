"""Finding Correlation Engine.

Before any findings reach the AI triage queue, this engine:
  1. Groups raw findings that represent the same underlying vulnerability
     (same category + similar URL + similar title).
  2. Merges each group into a single consolidated finding with a confidence
     score derived from how many independent scanners agree.
  3. Assigns an initial ValidationStatus based on confidence.

Confidence formula:
  - 1 source  → 30%  → POTENTIAL
  - 2 sources → 60%  → LIKELY
  - 3 sources → 80%  → LIKELY
  - 4+ sources→ 95%  → CONFIRMED (pre-triage)

This dramatically reduces noise and false-positive volume reaching Opus,
and means a finding that sqlmap, ZAP, and nuclei all flag independently
arrives at the agent already marked CONFIRMED with high confidence,
rather than as three separate items.
